I am a fifth year PhD Candidate in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan. I am completing my dissertation research under the supervision of Dr. Johann Gagnon-Bartsch. We are working on methodology to improve the analysis of high-throughput biological and pharmacogenomic data, particularly in the presence of unwanted variation.
